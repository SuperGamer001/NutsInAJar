# Nuts In A Jar Game
This was created for a CPTC project.

To run this project, open this on Visual Studio as a project and press the run button.

You will see two options, "I will guess", and "THe AI will guess".

<br>

## I will guess
Clicking on "I will guess" will open a difficulty window. There you will be asked which difficulty you would like.

### Easy (0 - 10)
You will have to guess a number between 0 and 10.

If you get it wrong, the AI will give you a hint on being too high or too low.

### Normal (0 - 30)
You will have to guess a number between 0 and 30.

The first 8 times you get it wrong, the AI will give you a hint on being too high or too low.

After the 8th attempt, it will give you no hints.

### Hard (0 - 80)
You will have to guess a number between 0 and 80.

The AI will not give you any hints.

## The AI will guess

The AI will guess a number between 0 and 50.
If it guesses all the numbers and you say "no" to all, it'll storm off and end the game on you.


## NOTE!
This app is a Winforms project, so this will not work on Mac.
